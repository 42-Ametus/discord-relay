# Discord Selfbot Relay
Discord Selfbot Relay allows users to plug in their token and relay messages from specific channel_ids to Discord webhooks.

# Purpose
This project was initially created as part of EVE Online's spy meta. After managing Intel-related tasks for many years and running one of the largest Intelligence Organizations in EVE Online, I developed this as a thank you to a member who greatly helped me. Itâ€™s a lightweight tool with several tricks, including:

# Features
* Relay messages from specific channel_ids to Discord webhooks.
* Preventing force embedding to detect channels being relayed.
* Pretending to be a web client to mimic Desktop Client.
* This is a basic version built from scratch, and while it works, a few bugs remain, mainly:

Known Bug: Roles and usernames not converting to text, but instead Discord ID. (<@ ) - I'll eventually fix this.
Feel free to submit issues if you find any bugs or have feature requests. I may eventually add new features or fix existing issues.

# Setup Guide
Install Node.js

You should see the relay output messages in the console.
Keep the Script Running

Leave the script running to maintain the relay.
